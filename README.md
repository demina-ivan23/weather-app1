So this project is for demonstration of my front-end skills and API skills. It's easy to use, undserstandable and flexible.
!IMPORTANT: as i was making this project, more features were available in free plan. Now, as things have changed, the project is half-deprecated((( I am really sorry for that, but you can still review the code of the project. Or, you can try weatherapi.com's 14-days free trial of starter or higher packs and see how my project works in action.
My project is, too, smartphone oriented, so the bg image may not lay as good as possible in pc mode.
